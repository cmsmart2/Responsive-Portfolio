                     Hello! I went to college when I was a measly 16 years old and I have yet to figure out what I want to be. I graduated with a bachelors degree in biology. Then I spent three years working as a Medical Technologist for Labcorp. While the medical life wasn't for me I did develop a passion for technology working with all of the advanced machinery. Next I moved on to an Account Manager position at Kansas City marketing. While I loved building a team, training, and talking to people sales was not for me. Now I find my self as a Customer Services Representative for Valutrust Solutions. This is an appriasal management company with a lot of big finanacial clients like J.G Wentworth. While it has been interesting learning about the financial and real estate world, I miss working with technology.

                     This is why I can't wait to learn more about programming and computers. Typically my creative outlet comes through painting. I love doing acrylic artwrok but designing webpages will be a whole new type of joy. This is becoming my new passion and I cannot wait to show off what I can now create.
